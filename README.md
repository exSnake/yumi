### What is TDD?

> Test-driven development (TDD) is an evolutionary approach to development
which combines test-first development, where you write a test before you write
just enough production code to fulfil that test, and refactoring. In other words,
itâ€™s one way to think through your requirements
or design before you write your functional code.
